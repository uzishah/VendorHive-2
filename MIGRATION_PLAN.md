# VendorHive Project Migration Plan

This document outlines the plan for migrating the VendorHive application from its current structure to the new modular structure.

## Current Structure
```
/
├── client/           # React frontend
├── server/           # Express backend
└── shared/           # Shared types
```

## Target Structure
```
/
└── vendorhive/
    ├── frontend/     # React frontend
    ├── backend/      # Express backend
    └── shared/       # Shared types
```

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Repository Setup (✓ Completed)
- [x] Create base `vendorhive` directory
- [x] Set up `frontend`, `backend`, and `shared` subdirectories
- [x] Configure package.json files for each directory
- [x] Update README documentation

### Phase 2: Code Migration
- [x] Copy shared types and schemas
- [x] Copy frontend components and pages
- [x] Copy backend routes and services
- [x] Update imports and file references
- [x] Ensure payment page consistency between both structures

### Phase 3: Configuration Updates (In Progress)
- [ ] Update configuration files (tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts)
- [ ] Update API endpoints in frontend
- [ ] Configure proper database connections
- [ ] Update environment variable references

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Test functionality in new structure
- [ ] Ensure consistent behavior with current app
- [ ] Update Replit workflow to use new structure
- [ ] Deploy and validate new structure

### Phase 5: Cleanup
- [ ] Remove old structure after successful migration
- [ ] Update all documentation
- [ ] Perform final testing

## Execution Plan

1. Complete development in current structure
2. Continue parallel development in new structure
3. Switch to new structure once fully validated

## Notes
- The current structure remains the primary working environment
- New features should be implemented in both structures to maintain parity
- The payment system will be developed without Stripe integration initially
