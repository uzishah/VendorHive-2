# VendorHive Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed plan for migrating the VendorHive application from a monolithic structure to a more modular architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend components.

## Phase 1: Setup and Structure (COMPLETED)
- [x] Create dedicated `backend/` and `frontend/` directories
- [x] Set up separate package.json files for each component
- [x] Create execution scripts for development workflow

## Phase 2: Backend Restructuring (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] Identify all data models and their relationships
- [x] Create individual model files for each entity:
  - [x] User model
  - [x] Vendor model
  - [x] Service model
  - [x] Booking model
  - [x] Review model
- [x] Create `models/index.ts` to export all models
- [x] Create database configuration module
- [x] Restructure application entry points
- [ ] Migrate route handlers to use new model structure
- [ ] Adapt storage interfaces to use new models
- [ ] Update authentication and middleware functions

## Phase 3: Frontend Restructuring (PLANNED)
- [ ] Review frontend component structure
- [ ] Update API service to integrate with new backend
- [ ] Ensure proper type definitions across frontend
- [ ] Update form validation to match backend schemas
- [ ] Test all frontend interactions with new backend

## Phase 4: Testing and Verification (PLANNED)
- [ ] Create test suites for new backend endpoints
- [ ] Test database operations with new models
- [ ] Verify authentication flows
- [ ] Test frontend integration with new backend
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing of critical workflows

## Phase 5: Integration and Deployment (PLANNED)
- [ ] Update workflow configurations
- [ ] Create automated testing pipelines
- [ ] Document the new architecture
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Perform final verification
- [ ] Switch to new architecture in production

## Current Status
- Backend restructuring is underway with the basic model structure completed
- Next steps involve adapting the route handlers and storage interfaces
- Frontend restructuring has not yet begun

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Breaking changes in API endpoints
  - **Mitigation**: Maintain backward compatibility during transition
  
- **Risk**: Data inconsistency during migration
  - **Mitigation**: Create data validation scripts

- **Risk**: Performance issues with new structure
  - **Mitigation**: Benchmark before and after migration

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Completed
- **Phase 2**: In progress (estimated completion: next 2-3 days)
- **Phase 3**: Not started (estimated duration: 2-3 days)
- **Phase 4**: Not started (estimated duration: 1-2 days)
- **Phase 5**: Not started (estimated duration: 1 day)

Total estimated time to complete migration: ~7-9 days
