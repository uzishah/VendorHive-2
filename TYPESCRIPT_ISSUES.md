# TypeScript Issues and Resolutions

This document outlines some TypeScript compilation issues identified in the codebase and provides suggested resolutions.

## Backend Issues

### 1. Vendor Schema Issues

**Issue:** Object literals with id property not allowed in vendor schema:
```typescript
Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'id' does not exist in type '{ userId: string | number; businessName: string; ... }'
```

**Resolution:**
- Update the vendor schema in `shared/schema.ts` to include id as an optional property for insert operations
- Update vendor creation code to handle id properly

### 2. String/Number Type Issues in userId

**Issue:**
```typescript
Argument of type 'string | number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
```

**Resolution:**
- Update the storage.ts methods to handle both string and number types for userId 
- Consider standardizing userId to be consistently either string or number throughout the codebase

### 3. Map Iterator Issues

**Issue:**
```typescript
Type 'MapIterator<Vendor>' can only be iterated through when using the '--downlevelIteration' flag
```

**Resolution:**
- Update the tsconfig.json to include the `downlevelIteration` flag
- Alternatively, convert map iterators to arrays before iteration:
  ```typescript
  Array.from(yourMap.values())
  ```

### 4. Service Creation Missing CreatedAt

**Issue:**
```typescript
Property 'createdAt' is missing in type '{ ... }' but required in type 'Service'.
```

**Resolution:**
- Fixed by adding createdAt property to service creation in storage.ts

### 5. Booking Status Type Issues

**Issue:**
```typescript
Type 'string' is not assignable to type '"pending" | "confirmed" | "completed" | "cancelled"'.
```

**Resolution:**
- Fixed by updating the updateBookingStatus method to use a union type for status

## Vite Configuration Issues

**Issue:**
```typescript
Type '{ allowedHosts: boolean; }' is not assignable to type 'ServerOptions'.
```

**Resolution:**
- Update the vite.ts file to use the correct type for allowedHosts:
  ```typescript
  allowedHosts: true // use boolean true instead of generic boolean
  ```

## Next Steps

These TypeScript issues don't prevent the application from running, but they should be addressed in the future for improved type safety and to prevent potential runtime errors.

The most critical issues have been fixed in the codebase, and others can be addressed as part of ongoing maintenance.
